        <p>
          In the summer of 2023, I participated in a three-month module called Orbital. The module focused on developing a practical application to address an issue I had identified as a student. Collaborating with my teammate, Zobelle, we developed and programmed a Productivity App called TrackIT.
          <br><br>
          Over the course of these three months, I acquired new skills and knowledge. I became familar with using React Native and JavaScript programming, allowing me to construct the front end of our application. Additionally, I learned how to integrate Firebase into our app, enabling efficient data management. I grasped fundamental principles of software engineering, including code organisation, testing, debugging, and the significance of creating an intuitive user interface.
          <br><br>
          The experience of building an app from the ground up was immensely gratifying. Witnessing our product come to life was truly rewarding. Through this project, I also developed essential soft skills. Effective teamwork, adept time management, and a strong work ethic became ingrained in my approach. Since our project was largely self-directed, my partner and I relied on online resources such as videos and forums for learning. Many challenges we encountered required seeking solutions from the bigger online developer community.

    <h2 class="orbital_title">What did we achieved?</h2>
    <div class="section2">
      <p>
        Our app, TrackIT, originated from the aspiration to decrease phone-related interruptions while studying. We recognized that smartphones pose a significant distraction, particularly for students. Our goal was to establish a platform that promotes self-discipline and nurtures productive study routines. TrackIT incorporates several key features to facilitate this objective.
      </p>
      <div class="section3">
        <div class="feature">
          <h2>Study Timer</h2>
          <p>The Study Timer accurately tracks study durations and pauses when the app is exited, ensuring precise time tracking.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <h2>To-Do List</h2>
          <p>The To-Do List empowers students to efficiently manage their time by planning tasks and allocating study slots.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <h2>Progress Tracking</h2>
          <p>Progress Tracking helps students monitor and refine their study habits by visualizing their learning journey.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <h2>Leaderboard</h2>
          <p>The Leaderboard fosters healthy competition among students and motivates active engagement in studies.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        In summary, TrackIT was developed to mitigate distractions caused by phones during study periods. Through its diverse features – Study Timer, To-Do List, Progress Tracking, and Leaderboard – the app aims to instill effective time management and focused learning practices within the student community.
